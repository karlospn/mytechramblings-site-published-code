          This post delves into the current .NET landscape when we aim to collect Code Coverage. We examine the most frequently used tools such as Coverlet, dotCover, and dotnet-coverage, among others. We discuss how to upload a Code Coverage report to a SaaS product like SonarQube. Lastly, we explain how to publish a Code Coverage report into an Azure Pipeline run or a GitHub Action.

          OpenTelemetry is a collection of APIs, SDKs, tools, and integrations designed for the creation and management of telemetry data, including traces, metrics, and logs. In today&#39;s post, I&#39;m going to demonstrate how you can begin using OpenTelemetry (OTEL) and distributed tracing with .NET.

          In this two-part series, I’m going to show you how to build and deploy a .NET 8 app container image that targets an ARM64 processor. In part 2, we will attempt to perform an end-to-end process. This will involve building a .NET 8 API, containerizing the app targeting an ARM64 processor using Azure Pipelines, and deploying it on AWS ECS Fargate. Furthermore, a benchmark will also be conducted to compare the performance of the application running on an ARM64 Fargate container versus an AMD64 Fargate container.

      <title>How to modernize a legacy .NET Framework WCF app using CoreWCF and .NET 7</title>

          CoreWCF is a port of the Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) framework to the latest .NET version. The main goal of the CoreWCF project is to enable existing WCF services to be moved to .NET 7. In this post I&#39;ll show you step by step how easy (or hard) is the process of migrating an existing .NET 4.7 WCF app to .NET 7 using the CoreWCF project.

          Keeping your container registry free of stale or unwanted images is a task that often gets overlooked when beginning working with containers in the enterprise. In this post, I want to show you how you can use ACR Tasks to automate this process when working with Azure Container Registry.

          A few months ago the built-in container support for the .NET SDK was announced. In this post I&#39;ll put this feature to test, I&#39;ll try to migrate from an application that contains a rather complex Dockerfile to a new version that has no Dockerfile and instead uses the container support feature.

          When talking about containers security on the enterprise one of the best practices is to use your own platform images, those platform images are the base for your company applications. In this post I&#39;m going to show you an opinionated implementation of how to automate the creation and update of your own .NET platform images using Azure Pipelines and AWS ECR.

          Almost any dotnet application has several NuGet dependencies, and those dependencies may have their own dependencies, and so on and so forth. What if any of those dependencies you&#39;re using contains a security vulnerability? You can check on your CI/CD pipeline if your application has any known NuGet vulnerability with just a couple of lines of bash script.

          The purpose of this post is to try out the new Azure DNS Private Resolver resource. To test it, we&#39;re going to try to solve one of the current issues that Azure VPN has right now: when connected over an Azure P2S VPN the private DNS zone resolution does not work. This becomes quite problematic when you&#39;re using private endpoints to secure some private resources, because there is no easy way to resolve the private endpoint DNS when connected to a P2S VPN.

          Like any other language, Dockerfiles can and should be linted for updated best practices and code quality checks.

          Deploying infrastructure as code on Azure using Azure Pipelines and Terraform requires a minimal bootstrap process. This process can be done manually, but you&#39;ll have to do it every time you want to start deploying resources into a new subscription. So, having some kind of automation seems the way to go here. And that&#39;s exactly what I want to show in this post, how to programmatically bootstrap an Azure subscription and an Azure DevOps project to start deploying Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.

          Vulnerability scanning allows us to review the security state of the container images and take actions to fix issues identified during the scan, resulting in more secure deployments. In this post I will be covering how you can use some of the most well-known scanners alongside with your Azure DevOps CI/CD YAML Pipelines.

          If you&#39;re using containers quite probably you&#39;re doing the build, test and analysis steps inside the Dockerfile, and setting up the SonarQube scanner when building the image can be a little more cumbersome than usual, and that&#39;s why I wanted to write a little bit about it.

Some of the problems I&#39;ll be talking about on this post are specific of the .NET implementation of gRPC and another ones are from the AWS side.

          Roslyn Analyzers are extensions that analyze source code and report violations. Some analyzers are built-into VS and some are third party ones which can be installed (like StyleCopyAnalyzers, FxCopAnalyzers, etc.). On today&#39;s post I will show you how you can configure your custom roslyn analyzers with an .editorconfig file.

          These past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been tinkering with AWS ECS Fargate and after losing some time tackling different approaches I thought it might be useful to write down what I ended up building, so without further ado let&#39;s dig in.

          These past years I worked with a few companies that uses Azure Active Directory to perform authentication and authorization on their line-of-business (LOB) applications and from time to time I get questions about how to register apps on AAD. Those questions are always pretty similar and most of the time the problem lies in some misconception, so I thought it might be a good idea to try to answer some of them and at the same time write them down in this post.

          GitOps is a way of implementing Continuous Deployment. The core idea of GitOps is having a Git repository that always contains declarative descriptions of the desired infrastructure, and in this post I&#39;ll be building a practical example of GitOps using Azure.

          What I wanted to talk in these post is how easy is to add a healthcheck endpoint in a WCF application, and how you can use it in case you want to move the application into the Cloud in the near future.

      <title>Enforce the use of a specific .NET Core version using Roslyn</title>

          In these past few years Microsoft has kept a steady flow of new .NET Core versions, and if you have hundreds of applications in your company it&#39;s almost impossible to keep them updated to the most recent version of the framework. If you want to enforce that everyone on your company is using the correct framework version when they create a new application you can use a Roslyn Analyzer.
