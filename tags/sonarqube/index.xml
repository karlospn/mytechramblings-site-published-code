          This post delves into the current .NET landscape when we aim to collect Code Coverage. We examine the most frequently used tools such as Coverlet, dotCover, and dotnet-coverage, among others. We discuss how to upload a Code Coverage report to a SaaS product like SonarQube. Lastly, we explain how to publish a Code Coverage report into an Azure Pipeline run or a GitHub Action.

          Right now there are 2 ways to add rules from a Roslyn Analyzer project into SonarQube. In this post I want to show you how both options work and also what&#39;re the pros and cons of one over the other.

          If you&#39;re using containers quite probably you&#39;re doing the build, test and analysis steps inside the Dockerfile, and setting up the SonarQube scanner when building the image can be a little more cumbersome than usual, and that&#39;s why I wanted to write a little bit about it.
