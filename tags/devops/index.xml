          This post delves into the current .NET landscape when we aim to collect Code Coverage. We examine the most frequently used tools such as Coverlet, dotCover, and dotnet-coverage, among others. We discuss how to upload a Code Coverage report to a SaaS product like SonarQube. Lastly, we explain how to publish a Code Coverage report into an Azure Pipeline run or a GitHub Action.

          This post demonstrates how to create an Azure DevOps Copilot that utilizes a small subset of the Azure DevOps REST API. To achieve this, we will be using Semantic Kernel along with .NET 8 and Azure OpenAI.

          In this two-part series, I’m going to show you how to build and deploy a .NET 8 app container image that targets an ARM64 processor. In part 2, we will attempt to perform an end-to-end process. This will involve building a .NET 8 API, containerizing the app targeting an ARM64 processor using Azure Pipelines, and deploying it on AWS ECS Fargate. Furthermore, a benchmark will also be conducted to compare the performance of the application running on an ARM64 Fargate container versus an AMD64 Fargate container.

          Right now there are 2 ways to add rules from a Roslyn Analyzer project into SonarQube. In this post I want to show you how both options work and also what&#39;re the pros and cons of one over the other.

      <title>Trying out the built-in container support for the .NET SDK</title>

          A few months ago the built-in container support for the .NET SDK was announced. In this post I&#39;ll put this feature to test, I&#39;ll try to migrate from an application that contains a rather complex Dockerfile to a new version that has no Dockerfile and instead uses the container support feature.

          When talking about containers security on the enterprise one of the best practices is to use your own platform images, those platform images are the base for your company applications. In this post I&#39;m going to show you an opinionated implementation of how to automate the creation and update of your own .NET platform images using Azure Pipelines and AWS ECR.

          Almost any dotnet application has several NuGet dependencies, and those dependencies may have their own dependencies, and so on and so forth. What if any of those dependencies you&#39;re using contains a security vulnerability? You can check on your CI/CD pipeline if your application has any known NuGet vulnerability with just a couple of lines of bash script.

          Like any other language, Dockerfiles can and should be linted for updated best practices and code quality checks. In this post I will show you how to incorporate a couple of Dockerfile linters into our Secure DevOps workflow to ensure our Dockerfiles are always readable, understandable and maintainable.

      <title>How to bootstrap Terraform and Azure DevOps to start deploying your infrastructure as code to Azure</title>

          Deploying infrastructure as code on Azure using Azure Pipelines and Terraform requires a minimal bootstrap process. This process can be done manually, but you&#39;ll have to do it every time you want to start deploying resources into a new subscription. So, having some kind of automation seems the way to go here. And that&#39;s exactly what I want to show in this post, how to programmatically bootstrap an Azure subscription and an Azure DevOps project to start deploying Infrastructure as Code with Terraform.

          Vulnerability scanning allows us to review the security state of the container images and take actions to fix issues identified during the scan, resulting in more secure deployments. In this post I will be covering how you can use some of the most well-known scanners alongside with your Azure DevOps CI/CD YAML Pipelines.

          These past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been tinkering with AWS ECS Fargate and after losing some time tackling different approaches I thought it might be useful to write down what I ended up building, so without further ado let&#39;s dig in.
